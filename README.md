# 🚀 TeleCloud

A modern fullstack monorepo built with NX, TypeScript, and GitHub Actions.
This project enables you to use Telegram channels as a cloud storage solution — free, scalable, and easy to use.

## 🌟 Features

- ✉️ Automatically extract chat IDs from forwarded messages
- ♻️ Parallel media uploads to multiple storage channels
- ⇪ Auto-upload files from PC to storage channels
- 🔄 Restore media from channels back to your local machine



## ⚙️ Setup

### 🧰 Bots and Channels Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. Create one or more Telegram bots using [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Add their tokens to your `.env` file:

   ```env
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENS=123456:abcdefg,123456:hijklmn
   ```

3. Create Telegram channels for storage. Add the bots from step 2 as **admins** in those channels. Then add the channel IDs to your `.env`:

   ```env
   STORAGE_CHANNEL_IDS=-123444,-123555
   ```

   Tip: Forward a message from a channel to a bot to get the channel's chat ID.

4. Add your user chat IDs (the bots will communicate with these users):

   ```env
   CHAT_IDS=1234,12345
   ```

5. Specify where to restore downloaded files:

   ```env
   RESTORE_OUTPUT_PATH=C:\Users\YourName\Desktop
   ```

6. Set your admin chat ID (used for logging or privileged actions):

   ```env
   ADMIN_CHAT_ID=1234
   ```
